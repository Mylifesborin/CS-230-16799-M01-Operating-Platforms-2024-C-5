The Gaming Room - "Draw It or Lose It" Software Design Document

Client and Requirements
The Gaming Room needed a design for their game, "Draw It or Lose It." 
They wanted it to work on multiple platforms, be secure, and handle a lot of players smoothly.

What Went Well
I think I did a good job breaking down the technical needs in a way that made sense for everyone. 
The setup I suggested for the platform and storage seemed like a good fit for what they needed.

How the Design Document Helped
Writing the design document helped me get organized and set a clear direction for coding. 
It gave everyone a solid idea of what the final setup should look like.

What I’d Change
If I could tweak something, 
I’d add more specifics on security to make sure user data stays protected.

Meeting User Needs
I focused on making the game easy to use and reliable. 
Putting the user experience first is key to building something people will actually enjoy.

My Design Approach
I aimed to keep everything flexible and consistent across different platforms, using Docker to make that happen. 
In the future, I’d keep focusing on tools like Docker and modular design to keep things scalable and user-friendly.
